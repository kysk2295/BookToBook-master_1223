this is BOOK TO BOOK project.

it is such an old project

i start this project at middle school second grade.

that time, i just use app inventor as i don't know how to use 
android studio..

But now, i developed for last 2 years and half year,now  i can use
android.

and this save of git is for my BTB design.

so glad to make this, since after MOCON project, which is 
unfortunately, crashed from design and back-end(it was team project)

this time, i developed by myself, which will never hurt friends
by time and scedule.

lastly, it has other meaning, which is end of my almost three year
project, end of my reposibility.
